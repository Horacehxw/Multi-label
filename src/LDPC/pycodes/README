Installing

   The  pycodes  package  provides various extensions to Python which are
   useful  in  developing  and  analyzing error correcting codes and data
   compression codes.

   Recently I also started adding routines for solving circuit 
   satisfiability problems in the pySAT module, but pySAT is somewhat
   incomplete at this point.

  Prerequisites

   You will need the following installed on your system to use pycodes:
     * Python (preferably version 2.2 or later)
     * biggles   (optional; only required if you want plotting)

  Installing

   Edit the file setup.py to edit installation options (e.g., if you want
   to  compile  in  debug  mode  or  optimization  mode.  Then,  in  this
   directory, execute the command

$ python setup.py install

   to compile the required python extensions and install them globally.

   After  the  installation  completes, you can use pycodes just like any
   other  python  module.  For  example,  to run the regression tests you
   could start python and do

>>> import pycodes, pycodes.tests
>>> pycodes.tests.DoRegressionTests()

   If you don't want to globally install pycodes, you can just compile it
   in  place  and  use it as a local python module. To do this, uncomment
   the lines for [build_ext] in setup.cfg and do

$ python setup.py build

   to  compile  everything.  Make  sure  that  the  name of the directory
   containing  the pycodes module is named pycodes and not something like
   pycodes-1.0.  To use pycodes, start python in the directory containing
   the  pycodes  directory.  For example, to run the regression tests you
   could do

$ python
>>> import pycodes, pycodes.tests
>>> pycodes.tests.DoRegressionTests()
