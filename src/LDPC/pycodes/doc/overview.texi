The pycodes package provides various extensions to Python which are
useful in developing and analyzing error correcting codes and data
compression codes (especially low density parity check codes).  The
code was originally developed by Emin Martinian; questions and
comments should be directed to him via @email{emin@@alum.mit.edu} or
@email{emin63@@alum.berkeley.edu}.  For copying, modificiation, and
distribution information, see the @ref{LICENSE}.

The following modules are provided:
@table @samp

@item pyLDPC 
Provides the main routines (which are implemented in C) as python commands.  

@item utils 
Provides utilities such as channels, encoders, routines to translate
things into linear programming relaxations, etc.

@item tests 
Provides automated tests both to analyze/evaluate codes and decoding
algorithms as well as to make sure everything is working correctly.
One simple way to run a given test is by importing the appropriate
file into python.  For example, the following commands executed in the
directory containing the pycodes directory would run a small BEC
quantization test:

@example
$ echo from pycodes.tests.quantization.BEC import small_BEC_perf | python
@end example

Similarly, you can run other tests in the directories
@file{pycodes/tests/quantization/BEC},
@file{pycodes/tests/channel_coding/BSC}, etc. by using a command like
the one above. 

@end table
